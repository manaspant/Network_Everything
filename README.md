# Network Everything 

This course explores the possibilities and challenges of designing alternate physical network inter-faces. Through weekly readings, class discussions, and a series of projects, students will create physical objects that talk to each other over distance. Various wireless communication mechanisms such as radio (Bluetooth, Zigbee, WiFi, and raw), infrared, and ultrasonic are used in the context of creating novel “smart” devices. Topics of discussion in this course include networking protocols and network topologies; network time versus physical time; mobile objects; and wireless networks. Opportunities to build collaborative and creative campus-wide networked projects and systems will also be explored.

### Reaction to Linked Chapter 1 - 3

I wasn't expecting the first two chapters to be about social networks. I thought since the class is about wifi and bluetooth, the reading will start ona similar note. I was pleasantly surprised to read about some of these concepts that I think would traditionally be considered a part of the social sciences.  
  
Now that I think about it, the idea of reductionism makes sense to me. We have spent so much time taking things apart and dividing the universe to the smallest element that we have made it harder for us to put it all together. As the author mentioned, there are so many possible ways of combining all these elements that it is going to be impossible to do it.  
  
The six degrees of separation was a very interesting idea now that I think about it. Although I dont think it is limited to just 6 links, I do believe that everyone on this planet can be connected in some way. As soon as I started reading about this idea, I started to think about the number of connections it would take to connect me to Trump.  
  
The project that led to the discovery of "19 degrees of separation" reminded me of a game that I used to play. The objective is basically to get one from one Wikdepedia page to another just by clicking links on the articles. For instance, if you are on a page about India, the objective could be to get on AC/DC's page just by clicking on the links on different pages. 

### Response: Designing connected products, Chapter 1 

The thing that struck me the most was in the part about the differences between designing for traditional products vs designing for IoT devices. For instance the part about how we dont expect glitches from the real world. Even thought I have used a few IoT devices till now, I had never considered this problem. One of the lines in the book said "This could make the real world start to feel very broken". I started to think about how I would react if everyday items that I use start feeling 'broken' once IoT pervades most aspects of life. Up untill now there has been a clear cut way of turning technology off from your life. You close the screen of your laptop, you're done. You switch off your phone, you're done. Regardless of how addicted you are to the device you are using, there is a concrete way of getting away from it. However, what happens when from switching the lights on to using the bathroom, every object has internet attached to it. How do we escape it then? I think I have gone more into the philosophy of IoT rather than the UX of it, but still some food for thought. 
  
The extreme story of the woman who could not shoot the intruder in her house because she was trying to authenticate her access to the gun seemed funny to me more than anything else. I was just imagining a woman pushing her thumb against the fingerprint scanner in the gun and cursing the internet. Reminds me of the NY Times article I read about how we are  unnecessary connecting a lot of things to the internet. This could probably be the same case.

### My hypothetical IoT

I was trying to think of something absolutely ridiculous to connect to the internet as an IoT device. However while reading the book for the class, I had an interesting idea. Making IoT books. This idea also seems liks an addition to the Internet of way too many things. I will, however, continue to show what the project will look like. 
The device will have different 'uses'. For people that do not want to use ebook readers or kindles, it will offer some reading statistics like speed of reading, time taken etc. 
In educational settings, it will keep a track of students' reading. For instance, Professors will be able to keep track of wther or not the students are reading. The device will do this based on the time spent by the student on each page. 

UI: The UI of the device will be very simple. It will be like a stick on device that you attach to the back of any book that you are reading. It will be lightweight and thin to not protrude out of the book too much. It wont have a screen. It will look like a clean strip of paper to someone looking from a distance. 

Interusability: The device will rank high in interusability because all you need to do is stick it to a different book whenever you are done with the one that you are reading. Thus it can be used with multiple books. Since the device is connected to the app that is on your phone, the app would not have to change with the book. 


### Final Project Idea

My final project idea is to make a hardware notification system for social media. The project is a satirical take on the state of social media usage these days. As if notifications on the mobile phone were not enough, this project takes it to a new level by notifying people about updates on a hardware device. So whenever you get a message or a notification or whenever a hashtag is trencing you will get a 'physical' notifcation.

#### Technical background

The aim is to use an API from a leading social media platform such as twitter or Facebook and get data from it. Based on the social media platform that I end up chossing finally, I will work on finding the notification or the aspect of that platform that I want to alert people to. So for instance, if I use Twitter, Ill decide whether I want to work with the trending hashtag or a celebrity tweet that people should be aware about. 
The hardware will most probably use a combination of DC motors that will create a physical effect that I am still deciding on. Some of the ideas that I have right now include:
1) A hand waving
2) A heart rate monitor output
3) A dopamine spike
