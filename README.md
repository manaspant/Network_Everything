### Reaction to Linked Chapter 1 - 3

I wasn't expecting the first two chapters to be about social networks. I thought since the class is about wifi and bluetooth, the reading will start ona similar note. I was pleasantly surprised to read about some of these concepts that I think would traditionally be considered a part of the social sciences.  
  
Now that I think about it, the idea of reductionism makes sense to me. We have spent so much time taking things apart and dividing the universe to the smallest element that we have made it harder for us to put it all together. As the author mentioned, there are so many possible ways of combining all these elements that it is going to be impossible to do it.  
  
The six degrees of separation was a very interesting idea now that I think about it. Although I dont think it is limited to just 6 links, I do believe that everyone on this planet can be connected in some way. As soon as I started reading about this idea, I started to think about the number of connections it would take to connect me to Trump.  
  
The project that led to the discovery of "19 degrees of separation" reminded me of a game that I used to play. The objective is basically to get one from one Wikdepedia page to another just by clicking links on the articles. For instance, if you are on a page about India, the objective could be to get on AC/DC's page just by clicking on the links on different pages.
