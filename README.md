# Network Everything 

This course explores the possibilities and challenges of designing alternate physical network inter-faces. Through weekly readings, class discussions, and a series of projects, students will create physical objects that talk to each other over distance. Various wireless communication mechanisms such as radio (Bluetooth, Zigbee, WiFi, and raw), infrared, and ultrasonic are used in the context of creating novel “smart” devices. Topics of discussion in this course include networking protocols and network topologies; network time versus physical time; mobile objects; and wireless networks. Opportunities to build collaborative and creative campus-wide networked projects and systems will also be explored.

### Reaction to Linked Chapter 1 - 3

I wasn't expecting the first two chapters to be about social networks. I thought since the class is about wifi and bluetooth, the reading will start ona similar note. I was pleasantly surprised to read about some of these concepts that I think would traditionally be considered a part of the social sciences.  
  
Now that I think about it, the idea of reductionism makes sense to me. We have spent so much time taking things apart and dividing the universe to the smallest element that we have made it harder for us to put it all together. As the author mentioned, there are so many possible ways of combining all these elements that it is going to be impossible to do it.  
  
The six degrees of separation was a very interesting idea now that I think about it. Although I dont think it is limited to just 6 links, I do believe that everyone on this planet can be connected in some way. As soon as I started reading about this idea, I started to think about the number of connections it would take to connect me to Trump.  
  
The project that led to the discovery of "19 degrees of separation" reminded me of a game that I used to play. The objective is basically to get one from one Wikdepedia page to another just by clicking links on the articles. For instance, if you are on a page about India, the objective could be to get on AC/DC's page just by clicking on the links on different pages. 

### Response: Designing connected products, Chapter 1 

The thing that struck me the most was in the part about the differences between designing for traditional products vs designing for IoT devices. For instance the part about how we dont expect glitches from the real world. Even thought I have used a few IoT devices till now, I had never considered this problem. One of the lines in the book said "This could make the real world start to feel very broken". I started to think about how I would react if everyday items that I use start feeling 'broken' once IoT pervades most aspects of life. Up untill now there has been a clear cut way of turning technology off from your life. You close the screen of your laptop, you're done. You switch off your phone, you're done. Regardless of how addicted you are to the device you are using, there is a concrete way of getting away from it. However, what happens when from switching the lights on to using the bathroom, every object has internet attached to it. How do we escape it then? I think I have gone more into the philosophy of IoT rather than the UX of it, but still some food for thought. 

The extreme story of the woman who could not shoot the intruder in her house because she was trying to authenticate her access to the gun seemed funny to me more than anything else. I was just imagining a woman pushing her thumb against the fingerprint scanner in the gun and cursing the internet. Reminds me of the NY Times article I read about how we are  unnecessary connecting a lot of things to the internet. This could probably be the same case.
