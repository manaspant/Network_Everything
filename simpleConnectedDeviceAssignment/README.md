### Safety Device

I am planning to make a device that warns people based on how close they are to my IoT.

The device can be used in different ways. One of my initial ideas was that it can be used as a safety device. So for instance, you can place the device in your cupboard. As soon as someone comes close to your cupboard shelves when you are not in your room, the device will warn you. 


I will be using an ultrasonic sensor that will detect the objet closest to the device.
